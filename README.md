# CAMDA24 Microbiom

## Description

The **Gut Microbiome based Health Index Challenge** features hundreds of WMS based taxonomic and functional profiles of healthy and unhealthy individuals. 

The following repository is a part of the analysis. The following is developed here:

- Taxonomic abundance
- Alpha and beta diversity
- Differential analysis of taxa and functions
- Venn analysis

These analyses were performed on the following metagenomic data:

- Intestine (data provided)
- Intestine (Kraken)
- Intestine (Braken)
- Covid
